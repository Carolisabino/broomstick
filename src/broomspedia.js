          "Toy broomsticks are the most docile type of broom. For safety reasons, these brooms do not accelerate very fast. Instead, they simply levitate small children off the ground. It is usually just enough so that their feet don’t touch the floor (about two feet)."

          "The Bluebottle is made to be a traveling broom, perfect for the entire family. As such, the speed of these brooms remains conservative, but faster than the toy brooms above. The Bluebottle's key concepts are that it is safe and reliable. But where it lacks in speed, the Bluebottle makes up for it with fancy features like the Built-In Anti-Burglar Buzzer. It gets a mention in an advertisement at the Quidditch World Cup, but the audience doesn't get to see it in action."
